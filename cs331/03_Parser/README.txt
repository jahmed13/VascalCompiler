Run compiler with main method in Main.java

The filename location is hardcoded. This was for purposes of testing. 
Included phase2-1.txt for testing with code
*Type out the filename location in the designated spots in Compiler.java and
SemanticAction.java*

Updates to complete Compiler:

Fixed bug with memory addressing that was occuring with GetSTEPrefix() 
in SemanticAction.java

Fixed calculation of memory size for array variables in Semantic Action #3

Followed the Java coding standards and conventions:
    
    - Renamed TestCompiler.java to Main.java and used the main() to create a 
      Compiler object that wraps up the rest of the compiler classes and has
      responsibility for managing operations

    - Declared all member variables and functions private except for those 
      which are called from outside that function

    - Made all class member functions and member identifier names UpperCamelCase

    - Formatted all curly braces to go on a line by themselves

    - Deleted braces for conditional or iteration statements that are only 
      one line

    - Added a space between reserved word and paranthesis

    - Added a header comment to each class describing its function

    - Added a comment above each function describing what the function does

Thank you for a great class Professor Ellis!
